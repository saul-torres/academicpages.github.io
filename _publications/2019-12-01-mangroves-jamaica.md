Mangrove forests play a critically important role in coastal protection. They can dissipate wave energy, which can lower flood risk and minimize erosion. Mangrove forests, however, are threatened by a number of natural and man-made factors, including storm events. Often times, mangroves are able to recover post-storm with limited intervention, but active post-storm restoration efforts are required to re-establish mangroves and hasten recovery, particularly when hydrological damage has occurred. Insurance is a unique market-based mechanism that can cost-effectively protect and restore coastal habitat. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, The Nature Conservancy helped launch the first-ever insurance product to protect coral reefs from storm damage. We consider whether a similar mechanism could be developed for the protection and restoration of mangroves following storm events.
